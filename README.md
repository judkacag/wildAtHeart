# wildAtHeart
With this project I recreated a data visualization I made earlier. When I first watched David Lynch's Wild at Heart I though, this might be the movie that would rank highest in the cigarettes smoked / minutes competiton. So when I replayed it a couple of months later, I logged all smoking, sex, sing, and violance scenes in the film. I plotter the scenes on a multiple radius circle and for the smoking scenes I used size to demonstrate the duration of the scene. The film starts at 3 * HALF_PI (at 12:00 AM if translated to reading a clock).
The biggest challenge was recreating something I already made, and making the elements (subtly) move. This was none other than a mental masturbation exercise but I'm still proud I saw it through.
